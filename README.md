# Capstone-Project
The topic of my capstone project is to experiment with several machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression, naïve bayes, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, and decisions trees, with the goal of creating a questionnaire application that can predict the risk of diabetes. Also, this capstone project will experiment with clustering the observations using Gower’s distance and Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) to see if clustering improves model accuracy.
